I help scaleups navigate technical challenges, AI-enable their organizations, and build for sustainable growth.

Having conducted due diligence for multiple acquisitions at Twilio, I help companies prepare for fundraising or M&A by identifying technical risks and opportunities before investors do.

Build high-performing engineering teams that scale with your business. From technical recruiting strategies to organizational structure design, I help you attract and retain top talent while creating the culture and processes that enable sustainable growth.

## My Philosophy

**People First:** Technical problems are usually people problems in disguise. I focus on building environments where teams can do their best work through collaborative problem-solving and open communication.

**Pragmatic Solutions:** Having seen both massive successes and expensive failures, I help you avoid the "shiny object syndrome" and focus on what actually moves the needle for your business.

**AI as a Force Multiplier:** The companies that thrive in the next decade won't be the ones with the best AI, but the ones that best integrate AI into their operations and products.
