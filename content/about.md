With 20+ years in Silicon Valley and 10+ years at Twilio where I built the Messaging product, I bring proven experience in scaling technology organizations from startup to IPO and beyond.

I help growing companies execute on technical fundamentals while building for sustainable growth.

## Experience

**Twilio (10+ years)**
- Built and scaled the Messaging product
- Led M&A due diligence for 4+ acquisitions
- Managed technical integrations and teams

**Silicon Valley Background**
- 20+ years across multiple startups and scaleups
- Deep experience with technical scaling challenges
- Understanding of what works (and what doesn't) at different growth stages

## What I Do

I work as a fractional/interim CTO with growing companies that need experienced technical leadership. Whether you're struggling with technical debt, team scaling, or preparing for your next funding round, I help you execute on the fundamentals while building for sustainable growth.

## Approach

My value comes from having "seen this movie before." I can quickly identify the technical and organizational patterns that will serve you well as you scale, and help you avoid the costly mistakes that derail many promising startups.
