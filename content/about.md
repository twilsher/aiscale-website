With 20+ years in Silicon Valley and 10+ years at Twilio where I built and scaled Messaging and IoT platforms, I bring proven experience in scaling technology organizations from startup to IPO and beyond.

I help growing companies execute on technical fundamentals, leverage AI for competitive advantage, and build for sustainable growth.

## Experience

**Twilio (10+ years)**
- Head of Engineering for Messaging (Twilio's flagship product) - grew from single team to 7-team organization across 3 countries
- Led Messaging platform through exponential growth while maintaining 5-nines uptime  
- Head of Engineering for IoT - grew from small team to 50+ engineers across US, Germany, and UK
- M&A due diligence and integration experience across 4+ successful acquisitions

**Silicon Valley Background**
- 20+ years across multiple startups and scaleups
- Deep experience with technical scaling challenges
- Understanding of what works (and what doesn't) at different growth stages

## What I Do

I work as a fractional/interim CTO with growing companies that need experienced technical leadership. Whether you're struggling with technical debt, team scaling, or preparing for your next funding round, I help you execute on the fundamentals while building for sustainable growth.

## Approach

My value comes from having "seen this movie before." I can quickly identify the technical and organizational patterns that will serve you well as you scale, and help you avoid the costly mistakes that derail many promising startups.
