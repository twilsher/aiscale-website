I work as a fractional/interim CTO helping scaleups navigate the critical transition from "scrappy startup" to "sustainable scale." My approach combines deep technical expertise with practical organizational experience.

## My Philosophy

**People First:** Technical problems are usually people problems in disguise. I focus on building environments where teams can do their best work through collaborative problem-solving and open communication.

**Pragmatic Solutions:** Having seen both massive successes and expensive failures, I help you avoid the "shiny object syndrome" and focus on what actually moves the needle for your business.

**AI as a Force Multiplier:** The companies that thrive in the next decade won't be the ones with the best AI, but the ones that best integrate AI into their operations and products.

## What Sets Me Apart

**Pattern Recognition:** From founding Twilio's Messaging team to growing it into a 7-team organization generating hundreds of millions in revenue, I've lived through hypergrowth at every stage.

**M&A Perspective:** Having evaluated and integrated multiple acquisitions, I understand what investors and acquirers really look for in technical organizations.

**Global Team Building:** Successfully scaling teams across multiple continents (US, Europe) while maintaining culture and productivity.

## What I Do

I work as a fractional/interim CTO with growing companies that need experienced technical leadership. Whether you're struggling with technical debt, team scaling, or preparing for your next funding round, I help you execute on the fundamentals while building for sustainable growth.

## Approach

My value comes from having "seen this movie before." I can quickly identify the technical and organizational patterns that will serve you well as you scale, and help you avoid the costly mistakes that derail many promising startups.
